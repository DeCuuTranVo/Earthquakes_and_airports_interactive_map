# Earthquakes and Airports Interactive Map
This repository contained the code I implemented in the couse Object-Oriented Programming in Java on Coursera. 
Through this course, I learnt to incorporate inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, event handling concepts in the program; and utilizing UML models in building the class hierarchy.
Reference: Starter code from UCSD Professors.

## Course Project: Earthquakes and cities visualization on world map. 
Interactively visualize earthquakes and affected cities with associated information (magnitude, depth, populations).

## Final Project: Tansonnhat International Airport-Vietnam, the flight routes out of this airport, and the destination cities.

### Program functionality

My program has several functionalities. First, my program takes input from a different source of data (airports and routes) to show all airports and flight routes on the world map. Second, I adjust the interactive behaviors of the program. Specifically, if the user hovers the mouse on the marker of an airport, a rectangular text box will appear and show information about the airport’s name, city, and country. Furthermore, if the user clicks on the marker of an airport, the map will display the clicked airport, the one-route-connected airports with the clicked airports, and the connecting flight route. In this case, unrelated airports and routes are hidden. Third, I modify the map's appearance by customizing the size, and color of the map legends. On the map, the clicked airport is marked with a big black circle with a green border, the airports being hovered are labeled with big black circles with white borders, and all the other airports are annotated with small white-bordered black circles. Additionally, the flight routes are denoted as gray straight lines. 
 
### Program implementation

To add the aforementioned features, I have made changes to two classes AirportMarker and AirportMap. In the class AirportMarker, I have three major changes. First, I add the instance private methods getCountry(), getAltitude(), getCity(), getName(), and toString() in order to get the properties from an airport’s marker (AirportMarker instance). Second, I implement the showTitle() method to extract airport information with the toString() method; and then draw a rectangular textbox that displays the selected airport’s name, city, and country. Third, I adjust the drawMarker() method to show different colors, sizes, and borders of an airport’s marker dependent on whether it is selected (isSelected variable), clicked (clicked variable), or neither selected nor clicked. 

Regarding the AirportMap class, I change a method’s local variable to an instance variable (HashMap<Integer, Location> airports) to make it visible to other instance methods. I all so create an addKey() method and call it in the draw() method to add a map legend section to the GUI. Furthermore, I introduce the mouseMoved() and selectedMarkerIfHover() methods to this class to draw an information textbox when I hover the mouse over an airport’s marker. Particularly, the mouseMoved() method uses the lastSelected instance of CommonMarker class to keep track of the currently chosen airport’s marker when the mouse moves. If an airport’s marker was selected, it will hide the lastSelected marker, and clear the last selection. Otherwise, this method will call selectedMarkerIfHover(), which in turn iterates through all airport markers in List<Marker> airportList, choose the airport’s marker under the mouse with AbstractMarker.isInside() method, select that marker using lastSelected, unhide that marker by set the selected variable on that marker, and the CommonMarker.draw() method will specify its appearance accordingly (including showTitle() method).

Another major change that I made is adding the unhideMarkers(), mouseClicked(), and checkAirportsForClick() methods to display the routes out of the clicked airports, and the airports at the other end of the routes. In unhideMarkers(), the code loops through and hides all the airport markers in List<Marker> airportsList and route markers in List<Marker> routeList with Marker.setHidden() method. In the mouseClicked() method, the lastClicked instance of the CommonMarker type is monitored when the mouse is clicked. If there is a clicked airport marker in lastClicked, the method will call unhideMarkers() to unhide all markers, set the lastClicked to be unclicked for appropriate display configuration, and set the lastClicked variable to null. In another case, the method will call checkAirportsForClick(), which does the following steps: (1) Looping through the airport markers and choose the unhidden clicked one (if any) with Marker.isHidden() and Marker.isInside() conditions. (2) Returning if no markers are set in lastClicked (the clicked position has no markers) (3) Looping through all markers (both airports and routes) and hiding the markers that are different from the lastClicked airport marker (4) Looping through the routeList, extracting the Location sourceLocation and Location destinationLocation from the current route using HashMap<Integer, Location> airports, finding the routes that are connected to the lastClicked airport by Location comparison with airportLocation, and unhiding those routes. Afterward, loop through those routes to find the airport locations at the other end of the routes, get the airportMarker through Location comparisons, and unhide those airports.

Through those steps, I implemented the final project for the course Object-Oriented Programming in Java, fulfilled the passing requirements, and concluded my effort in course 3 of 4 of the Object-Oriented Programming in Java from UCSD.
